I need to make a website for Griot Theater
The navigation bar has Home, Features, Our Actors, Mission, Contact

I see a background photo with Featured Shows on top


I see a grid layout
Theres a date at the top that says April 2020

Theres 4 photos stacked in columns and separated by a divider. 
I will need to format the grid like:

Picture - Text - "Read More" [button or container with border?]

I will write the code once but will need to paste this 3 more times.
Background is white, footer and navbar is black

"pre" can be used to format text like this
pre
blah blah blah
blah blah
blah
/pre


The footer has a picture, and broken up into 3 columns
